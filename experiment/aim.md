### Aim of the Experiment

The objective of this experiment is to interface a **DHT11 sensor** with a **Raspberry Pi** and develop a **Python program** to read and display real-time **temperature and humidity** data. This experiment highlights the process of **sensor integration** with the Raspberry Pi using its **GPIO (General-Purpose Input/Output) pins**, demonstrating how embedded systems can interact with the physical environment.  




The integration of the **DHT11 sensor** with a **Raspberry Pi** has numerous real-world applications, including:  

1. **Weather Monitoring Systems**  
- Collects **temperature** and **humidity** data to create a **local weather station**.  
- Can be combined with cloud storage to **log data** over time for trend analysis.  

 2. **Smart Agriculture**  
- Monitors **temperature** and **humidity** in **greenhouses** to optimize **crop growth**.  
- Helps automate **irrigation systems** by integrating with soil moisture sensors.  

 3. **Home Automation & Smart Homes**  
- Controls **HVAC (Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning) systems** based on room temperature.  
- Sends alerts to **smartphones** or **IoT dashboards** when humidity levels exceed thresholds.
