### Aim of The Experiment 
To interface a DHT11 sensor with a Raspberry Pi and write a Python program to print temperature and humidity readings, this experiment demonstrates sensor integration using the Raspberry Piâ€™s GPIO pins to collect data from the DHT11, a digital temperature and humidity sensor, with applications in weather monitoring, smart agriculture, and home automation.
