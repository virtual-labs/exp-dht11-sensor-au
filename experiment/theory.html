DHT11 Sensor - The DHT11 is a compact digital sensor that integrates two sensing
elements into a single package: a temperature sensor and a humidity sensor. The
temperature sensor is an NTC (Negative Temperature Coefficient) thermistor,
which decreases its resistance as temperature increases, while the humidity
sensor is a resistive-type element that changes resistance based on moisture
levels in the air. An onboard 8-bit microcontroller processes the analog signals
from these sensors and converts them into a digital output, which is transmitted
as a single-wire serial signal. The DHT11 has three terminals: VCC (power
supply), DATA (signal output), and GND (ground). These terminals allow it to
interface easily with microcontrollers like the Raspberry Pi. The sensor
operates within a voltage range of 3.3V to 5.5V, measures temperature from 0°C
to 50°C (±2°C accuracy), and humidity from 20% to 80% (±5% accuracy), making it
suitable for basic environmental monitoring. A hygrometer is an instrument used
to measure water vapor in the atmosphere. Humidity sensors, like the one in the
DHT11, typically rely on changes in electrical properties (e.g., resistance or
capacitance) influenced by moisture, temperature, or other environmental
factors. The DHT11’s combination of temperature and humidity sensing makes it
ideal for applications such as weather stations. We can create your own IoT
Weather Station by connecting the DHT11 Sensor to the Raspberry Pi. A Raspberry
Pi, a DHT11 Humidity and Temperature Sensor, and a computer with Internet
connectivity are all required to build such IoT Weather. Components used in this

First and foremost, ensure that your Raspberry Pi is turned off. This is quite
crucial. Never connect or disconnect any hardware component while your Pi is
switched on. You might harm it, for example, with an ESD (Electro Static
Discharge), or perhaps entirely destroy it, if you connect the incorrect pins.
RASPBERRY PI - Raspberry Pi is a pocket-sized computer with GPIO ports for
connecting to various sensors and peripherals, making it an excellent platform
for embedded developers. It is a board with an ARM architecture CPU developed
for electronic engineers and enthusiasts. The PI is currently one of the most
trustworthy project development platforms available. The Raspberry Pi, with its
faster CPU and more RAM, may be utilized for a variety of high-profile projects
such as image processing and Internet of Things. The high-end Raspberry Pi 4
with 8GB RAM is now available. The Raspberry Pi features a strong capability
known as General Purpose Input/Output (GPIO) Pins. GPIO Pins serve as the
physical interface between the outside world and the Raspberry Pi. Through these
GPIO Pins, various external components like as LEDs, Motors, Sensors, Displays,
and so on are linked to the Raspberry Pi. In this Experiment, we will use the
Raspberry Pi to blink an LED, therefore understanding all of the GPIO Pins is
essential. 40 GPIO Pins are available on the Raspberry Pi 3 Model B. Few of the
40 GPIO pins are power pins, such as 3.3V Pins (2), 5V Pins (2), and GND (8).
Few of the remaining 28 pins are actually general purpose GPIO pins, while a few
have a dual use. For the Raspberry PI, there are 40 output pins. However, all 40
pins may be programmed. Only 26 of the GPIO pins can be programmed. These are
the pins that connect GPIO2 to GPIO27.The remaining pins are utilized for
various specific tasks; there are 17 GPIO left (Light green Cirl). Each of these
17 GPIO pins may provide up to 15mA of current. Furthermore, the aggregate of
all GPIO currents cannot exceed 50mA. As a reslit, we may plil a maximum of 3mA
from each of these GPIO pins on average.
